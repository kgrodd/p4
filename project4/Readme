Contributions:
Tyler: Insert, Update, Select
Kyle: Create Index, Drop Index, Delete, Describe
We split the work down the middle and than
assisted eachother in debugging the separate
parts.  

Features:
All of the assigned features work as intended
and passed the given sql test file as well as 
additional sql files we created for testing. 
These included create and drop Index, insert and
delete, update, describe and select.  

Optimization:
For optimization, for first select, i just basically iterated through each schema looking for a match to all predicates. Using my schema and table array, i would set a flag if select should happen first and swap that schema and table in the arrays with the first index. This works well with the code made and isn't really relevant to the opt. 

Next for optimization, i made a simple bubble sort and just sorted all the tables based upon record count. This method is created in the Select.java code along with the previous optimization. There is a small comment for both!! I used this optimization , basically it is slightly more optimal than the naive solution and for the fact that if you have three tables, say A, B, C, D and E. A-D have 3 records, and E has 17 records. Now, you have a join of E to A to B to C to D to E. Then that means that it would be 17 cross product of 3 and then that cross product of 3 , 3 more times. Which is a lot, now if i sort on recCount. Then i would cross 3 four times, then 17 , carrying over alot less per cross product than the previous naive solution.
